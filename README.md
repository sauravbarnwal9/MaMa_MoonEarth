We were a team of 7 from the Masai Web-18 batch who worked on cloning the Adidas website as part of our Unit-2 construct week. As a team, we were given a project to clone the Adidas website. Our project demonstrates a basic flow of an e-commerce page, where a customer can view and filter products, add their product to a cart and place his or her happy order.
